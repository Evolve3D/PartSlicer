# PartSlicer

This is a simple tool to split a gcode file into multiple individual gcode files to be printed.
The parts are sliced in a way that it allows multicolor print with single extruder. 
This is just another way of doing the job by multiple gcode files rather than having one gcode file to finish it all.
Also useful in situation where the 3d printer's firmware cannot be modified hence unable to add multicolor printing function by the mean of updating firmware.
